# HouseHunting-Marketplace

This app was coded along the course I was studying from. This e-realstate app is codede in React and it works with Firbase and Firestore on the backend. Some features about the funtionlity are the state being handled by Redux, the implementation of the Firestore API plus Authentication through hashed passwords and the use of tokens.
